Great. I'll add some slides to the presentation and add an introduction to the README in the master branch.
 
I'll also try using different models on different splits of the data to see if results improve.
 
Then, I'll look into the audio model predictions.
 
Thanks.

@Patrick Jean-Baptiste Hi Patrick, can you add a introduction to the readme in master branch? I added our audio part, but I am not sure video part, thank you.
 
Best,
Yunhua

I see :) you do not need to re-run it again, you can report old results if you have them with you. Or just use the code I shared with you, it is working. Whichever easier for you.

Thank you Patrick,
 
I got an 15% accuracy with the csv file split, it is random too, so I think maybe there is some problem with my code to process the files.
But you got similar accuracy, there also may be some mis-match in the csv with the file and label? just a guess.
 
For the slides part, how about use the previous one?

Hi All,
 
I finished training the visual model using the train, validation, and test set from the .csv file.
I also got an accuracy of 15% for training and an accuracy of 16% for testing.
 
I decreased the number of epochs and the batch size, but the model does not give above 25% accuracy. 
 
The notebook is on GitHub called "visual_emotion_recognition.ipynb".
 
I will attempt to keep adjusting the model to see if I can get better results, but I don't think merging audio and visual would give better results since we got similar results on separate models.
 
Where can I add slides to the presentation?
 
Regards,
Patrick Jean-Baptiste

I did not use your code, I did it by myself last night, I create the dictionary of filename and filepath,
and I tried dropout and some ideas I know to my model, but it still does not work, if we have time, ok, let us try to read some papers to get a better result, I mean it is too late.
 
Besides, the professor said he does not care about our accuracy result, I think just show him what we already did, show him our work, we tried and got some result, even it is not perfect result, but we tried my ways.
 
We already tried train audio-song, audio-speech, audio-song-speech, video-only, if Patrick could merge video-audio, then we have this result also, if can not, I think we just tell the honest what we already did.
And how we struggled, what do you think?

"I mean we could present the separate result, like video a result and audio a result
then give a merge result.” Of course, we should definitely do that.
 
Okay, it is alright, if you are saying your model is doing worse then I can share mine. 
 
"Besides, my model got 15% accuracy with the csv file it must be some problem but using randomly split I got less 70% accuracy I will try to find my previous code."
 
Yes, there should be a mistake because I got 70 with your code using the csv file and I shared it with you. But it was overfitting, then you said we could get  a better result with Dropout etc.  I thought you were going to use that notebook and see if you can improve it. 
 
the notebook I am talking about https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PUnLKPBx2BLT4TL5S0FO_L1hPeZqg2I2?usp=sharing
 
If you did not work on that notebook and do not have time to work on the project anymore, it is alright. Just let me know.

What do you mean by “other” work ? Patrick needs your model results to merge the models. I can share with him but I need your model. So you need to tell us what is the best model architecture for song and speech. 
 
We can show all results, we just need to explain what is the input, what is the result and why it is good or bad ?
We cannot just share results of song because it is good.

Hi Enis, 
 
I updated the emotion images folder and added the 12 emotion images from the song files of actor 20. I just selected a different video frame and I was able to detect the face.
 
I also updated the .csv file with the information from the 12 images.
 
There are still two images missing from the videos. I think they are from the speech files of actor 17 since those files were not in the downloaded folder.

I extracted one emotion image per video. 14 videos were not used since a face could not be detected. 12 of them were from the song files of actor 20.
 
I also sent a .csv file that matches the video file name with the emotion.

Hi Patrick,
 
Please share the images with us also. You can upload them to the same Dropbox link again. 
 
Me and Yunhua made some mistakes and found each other’s bugs by running each other’s code. We should do the same with yours. Please, make sure the notebook that you train the model is self-sufficient that I can run it from beginning to end without spending too much time on it. If you like you can check my notebooks, for example I download data from the Dropbox in the first cell so that notebook does not depend on data on my local. And anyone can run it without any extra effort.

Hi,
 
I was reading the data for the train, validation, and test sets, and I noticed that we are using different data for audio and video that do not correspond to each other.
 
For audio, there are 2452 files for speech and song combined.
For audio-visual and video only, there are 2880 files for just speech.
 
We can match the audio and video files if we either:
 
1). Use only the speech files which be 1440 files for audio and 1440 files for video.
 
2). Have me download the song files for video, which would lead to 2452 audio files and 2452 video files. It could take me a while for me to download the files.
 
For the image files I sent you, if it begins with "02", it is video only.
 
Let me know what you prefer we do.

I think code should go to script folder and you can place the notebooks under the notebooks folder inside a folder with your name. You do not need to share the images, I think. You should generate embeddings or a prediction for the each video/sample then we can merge with audio embedding/predictions to make final decision and calculate precision. We might also consider merging networks later. Also, please share which files you use for training and which ones for validation and/or test. So we can use the same.
 
By the way, how was the discussion yesterday,  it was too late here, I could not join. What did you talk about ?

I just need to extract the face from the video frames. I can get multiple face images per video (at least 50 images) that show emotion.
 
So, we should have a lot of data for face images. I will try to organize the images and upload them to my OneDrive account. Then, I will send you all a link where you can download the images if you want.
 
I have some code available that I need to finish up. I can upload it to the GitHub repository.
 
I just need to know which folder should I upload the code in?

Yeah, we need that for final report but it sounds like we need to prepare a update report 10 slides or so as well.

Formal Status meetings
Posted on: Wednesday, April 29, 2020 11:38:34 AM EDT
As I mentioned last class I want to get a formal status on every project. That means about 10 slides or so. I don't want to see fluff. I want to see per person specific activity (notebooks, scripts, libraries, documents) in the github. You should link to your group on blackboard. You should change your group name to reflect the project goal. You should make bar graphs showing things like commits per person, or closed issues per person. This is the kind of thing I will be looking at at the final analysis. By default, assume I am skeptical about work done. Thanks,
michael

Hi Enis,
 
I think the last class we need to do the presentation for our project, but I am not sure about the paper presentation time.
 
Best regards,

Hi,
 
Thank you for the GitHub invitation. It might be late for us all to discuss the project today.
Any time after 1:00pm is fine with me if we want to meet tomorrow.
 
We should start planning the next steps of project, and how we are going to build the model.
 
Regards,
Patrick  Jean-Baptiste

Hi All,
 
I found an audio-visual dataset of emotional speech called RAVDESS. It does not require an account to access, and it has several actors with different emotions. 
 
The dataset can be found here:
https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XqN9yG5Fw2x
 
Here is a sample of the RAVDESS videos:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7OQoNEu3dY
 
Here is the paper:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196391&type=printable
 
I think this dataset has plenty of data that we can work with, and it is labeled.
 
Let me know if you want to work with this dataset or if you prefer another dataset.
 
Stay safe,
Patrick Jean-Baptiste
