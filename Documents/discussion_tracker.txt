Hi All,
 
If you want to have a discussion, tomorrow afternoon is fine with me. Just let me know what time.
 
I'm almost done processing images and I should start building the visual networks soon.

Yeah, good idea.
 
The project discussions were done on Zoom. My computer's audio does not work so I could not hear the discussions or say anything. I tried reloading the page and my computer crashed so I don't know what the project discussions were about.

I think code should go to script folder and you can place the notebooks under the notebooks folder inside a folder with your name. You do not need to share the images, I think. You should generate embeddings or a prediction for the each video/sample then we can merge with audio embedding/predictions to make final decision and calculate precision. We might also consider merging networks later. Also, please share which files you use for training and which ones for validation and/or test. So we can use the same.
 
By the way, how was the discussion yesterday,  it was too late here, I could not join. What did you talk about ?

I processed a few videos, and I am able to detect the face of the speaker in the video.
 
I just need to extract the face from the video frames. I can get multiple face images per video (at least 50 images) that show emotion.
 
So, we should have a lot of data for face images. I will try to organize the images and upload them to my OneDrive account. Then, I will send you all a link where you can download the images if you want.
 
I have some code available that I need to finish up. I can upload it to the GitHub repository.
 
I just need to know which folder should I upload the code in?

I guess others are not seeing the emails, half of us does not have mics anyway, maybe we can just update each other through email or we can start a Whatsapp/telegram group?

Formal Status meetings
Posted on: Wednesday, April 29, 2020 11:38:34 AM EDT
As I mentioned last class I want to get a formal status on every project. That means about 10 slides or so. I don't want to see fluff. I want to see per person specific activity (notebooks, scripts, libraries, documents) in the github. You should link to your group on blackboard. You should change your group name to reflect the project goal. You should make bar graphs showing things like commits per person, or closed issues per person. This is the kind of thing I will be looking at at the final analysis. By default, assume I am skeptical about work done. Thanks,
michael

Hi,
 
Thank you for the GitHub invitation. It might be late for us all to discuss the project today.
Any time after 1:00pm is fine with me if we want to meet tomorrow.
 
We should start planning the next steps of project, and how we are going to build the model.

Hi All,
 
I found an audio-visual dataset of emotional speech called RAVDESS. It does not require an account to access, and it has several actors with different emotions. 
 
The dataset can be found here:
https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XqN9yG5Fw2x
 
Here is a sample of the RAVDESS videos:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7OQoNEu3dY
 
Here is the paper:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196391&type=printable
 
I think this dataset has plenty of data that we can work with, and it is labeled.
 
Let me know if you want to work with this dataset or if you prefer another dataset.
 
Stay safe,
Patrick Jean-Baptiste
